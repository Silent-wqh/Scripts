**Example prompt:** ¬†You are a time-traveling dinosaur expert. **You have just arrived in the late Cretaceous period, and you‚Äôre here to study the social lives of dinosaurs.**

In our prehistoric adventure example, we set the stage by sending our time-traveling dinosaur expert to the late Cretaceous period. The context is rich and engaging, with a focus on studying the social lives of dinosaurs. This allows ChatGPT to immerse itself in the prehistoric world and generate content that is both entertaining and relevant to the assigned role and task.

## 3. Responsibility (R) - Give ChatGPT a Task

Assigning a clear and compelling task for ChatGPT is crucial to guiding its responses and ensuring that the output aligns with your expectations. When designing a task, keep the following tips in mind to make the most of your interaction with the AI:

### Define the task clearly

Explicitly state the task or objective for ChatGPT, making sure the instructions are easy to understand. This helps the AI focus on the desired outcome and produce responses that are relevant to your needs.

### Encourage creativity and humor

Assign tasks that allow ChatGPT to showcase its creativity and sense of humor. This not only makes the interaction more entertaining but also demonstrates the AI‚Äôs ability to think outside the box and generate unique content.

### Challenge ChatGPT

Don‚Äôt be afraid to assign tasks that are complex or thought-provoking. Challenging ChatGPT can lead to more engaging and insightful responses, as the AI is pushed to explore different perspectives and ideas.

### Link the task to the role and context

Make sure the task aligns with the role and context you‚Äôve provided. This helps create a coherent narrative and ensures that ChatGPT‚Äôs responses are consistent with the established background.

With a clear role and context, it‚Äôs time to explicitly state the task or job for ChatGPT. For our example, let‚Äôs assign a humorous task like creating a dating profile for a T-Rex.

**Example prompt:** You are a time-traveling dinosaur expert. You have just arrived in the late Cretaceous period, and you‚Äôre here to study the social lives of dinosaurs. **Your job is to create a witty and charming dating profile for Terry, a lonely T-Rex looking for love.**

The task is clearly defined, encourages creativity and humor, and presents a challenge that pushes ChatGPT to come up with a witty and charming dating profile for our lonely T-Rex, Terry.

## 4. Interpret (I) - Check ChatGPT‚Äôs Understanding

Before diving into the task, it‚Äôs essential to verify that ChatGPT understands the role, context, and responsibility you‚Äôve provided. Asking the AI to interpret your instructions helps ensure that it has grasped the essence of the task, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. To make the most of this step, consider the following tips:

### Ask for confirmation

Simply ask ChatGPT if it understands the task by posing a question like ‚ÄúDo you understand?‚Äù This allows the AI to either confirm its comprehension or request clarification, ensuring that both you and the AI are on the same page.

### Request a summary or paraphrase

To further gauge ChatGPT‚Äôs understanding, you can ask it to summarize or paraphrase the task in its own words. This helps you identify any discrepancies between your instructions and the AI‚Äôs interpretation, allowing you to address any misunderstandings before proceeding.

### Clarify any ambiguities

If ChatGPT seems confused or unsure about any part of the task, take the time to clarify your instructions. Clear communication is key to obtaining the desired output and helps prevent frustration or wasted time on irrelevant responses.

Before proceeding, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure ChatGPT understands the task. Asking‚ÄúDo you understand?‚Äù allows the AI to confirm its comprehension or seek clarification.

### Optional Interpretations

For tasks that require more logical thinking, it is recommended you add the phrase ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù to your prompt. This encourages ChatGPT to outline the steps it takes to get to an answer, which typically provides more accurate answers.

For tasks that you want ChatGPT to output a specific format, it is recommended that you give ChatGPT an example, which will help it provide what you need.
